# Implementation of Multi-Task Multi-Sensor Fusion for 3D Object Detection

## Introduction
#Great Project

This project is a pytorch implementation of Multi-Task Multi-Sensor Fusion for 
3D Object Detection paper, which is a end-to-end network to predict 3D
bounding boxes using LIDAR point cloud and images.
